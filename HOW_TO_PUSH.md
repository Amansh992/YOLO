# 🔑 How to Push to GitHub

## ❌ Issue: Token Authentication Failed

The provided token doesn't have the right permissions. Here's how to fix it:

## ✅ Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Generate a NEW Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: `YOLO Project`
4. Check these scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `workflow` (if you want GitHub Actions)
5. Click "Generate token" at the bottom
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

### 2. Update the Remote URL with YOUR NEW TOKEN

```bash
cd /home/ar-in-u-359/Desktop/YOLO
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_NEW_TOKEN@github.com/Amansh992/YOLO.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. OR Use GitHub Desktop (Easiest!)

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. File → Add Local Repository → `/home/ar-in-u-359/Desktop/YOLO`
4. Click "Publish repository"
5. Done!

## 📊 Current Status

## 🎯 Quick Test

Try this command to verify your token works:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_NEW_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

You should see your GitHub username in the response.
