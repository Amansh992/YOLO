# 🚀 START HERE - YOLOv12 Satellite Detection

## ✅ Everything Stopped and Ready

All processes have been stopped. GPU is clean and ready to use.

## 📋 Quick Start Commands

### **To Train the Model:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/train.py --data dataset/data.yaml --batch 4 --epochs 100
```

### **To Launch Dashboard:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
streamlit run dashboard/app.py --server.port 8501
```

### **To Check Training Progress:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python check_training.py
```

## 🎯 What Happens When You Run Training

1. Training starts with batch size 4 (optimized for your 4GB GPU)
2. Will run for 100 epochs (~40 minutes)
3. Best model saves to: `runs/detect/xview_train/weights/best.pt`
4. Real-time progress displayed in terminal

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ Virtual environment ready
- ✅ Dataset prepared (676 train, 126 val images)
- ✅ All processes stopped
- ✅ GPU memory available (4GB)
- ✅ Training script optimized (batch=4, workers=2)

## 🛠️ Need Help?

- **Training fails?** Check `TRAINING_NOTES.md`
- **Out of memory?** Reduce batch size further: `--batch 2`
- **Want to train longer?** Increase epochs: `--epochs 200`

## 🎉 Ready to Start!

Just run the training command above and let it run!
