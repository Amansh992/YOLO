# 🚀 Training Status

## ✅ Current Status

Training is running with reduced memory settings!

### Memory Optimization Applied:

- **Batch size**: 4 (reduced from 16)
- **Workers**: 2 (reduced from 8)
- **Model**: YOLOv12s (small)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 500 (4GB)

### Expected Results:

- Training time: ~40 minutes for 100 epochs
- Memory usage: ~256MB GPU
- Model will save to: `runs/detect/xview_train/weights/best.pt`

## 📊 Monitoring Training

### Check Progress:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python check_training.py
```

### Check GPU Memory:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

### View Training Logs:

```bash
tail -f runs/detect/xview_train/results.csv
```

## 🎯 After Training

Once training completes:

1. Model will be saved to `runs/detect/xview_train/weights/best.pt`
2. Launch dashboard: `streamlit run dashboard/app.py --server.port 8501`
3. Test your trained model!

## 🔧 Memory Issues?

If training still fails with OOM:

- Reduce batch size further: `--batch 2`
- Reduce image size: `--imgsz 416`
- Use smaller model: `--model n`

## 📝 Notes

- Training is running in background
- Estimated completion: ~40 minutes
- You can close this terminal and training will continue
- Check progress anytime with `check_training.py`
